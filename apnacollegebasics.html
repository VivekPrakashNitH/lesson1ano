<!-- now the first git command we are going to learn is git clone it is nothing but simply used to clone a repository into our local machine  -->
<!-- cd means change directory so yes remember it  -->
<!-- ls means list files -->
<!-- ls gives all the files present inside the directory but not the hidden ones but ls -a gives all the files even the hidden ones -->
<!-- now there is something known as status command  works only on git repositories which i have downloaded-->
